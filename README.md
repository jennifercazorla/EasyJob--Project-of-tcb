This project was carried out in the subject of computation techniques, also it was developed with another college whose name is Anna Maria Llopart. 
The objective of this project was to create a website in which by creating an account facilitate the communication between companies looking for employees and unemployed people looking for work.
Due to the lack of time to finish completely the development of the idea, what we have implemented was the creation of accounts depending on whether you are an employee or company, if you are a company be able to publish offers and if you are a person looking for work then you can see the offers that are available. The limitations it has is that it does not keep any data when it is closed, does not create new csv, what we have done is that it can read data from a csv and therefore, we had some files already created with information from different accounts that are invented, but they ar not updated.
One of the things that could be improved, is that companies receive requests from interested people, through buttons can accept or decline them and the interested person receives an instant response.
All the data that we used to developt this project was given in the classes of this subject and the doubts that have arisen have been the result of the teacher, Patricia Carbajo Flores.
