This project was carried out in the subject of computation techniques, and it was also developed with another college whose name is Anna Maria Llopart. 

The objective of this project was to create a website that, by creating an account, facilitates communication between companies looking for employees and unemployed people looking for work. Due to the lack of time to finish the development of the idea, what we have implemented is the creation of accounts depending on whether you are an employee or a company. If you are a company, you will be able to publish offers, and if you are a person looking for work, you can see the offers that are available. The limitations it has are that it does not keep any data when it is closed and does not create new csv, what we have done is that it can read data from a csv, and therefore, we had some files already created with information from different accounts that were invented, but they were not updated. One of the things that could be improved is that companies receive requests from interested people and, through buttons, can accept or decline them, and the interested person receives an instant response. 

All the data that we used to develop this project was given in the classes on this subject, and the doubts that have arisen have been the result of the teacher, Patricia Carbajo Flores.
